    "Heart disease is an umbrella term for a vast range of conditions that affect the heart. While there are many leading causes that can contribute to higher risks to heart disease, unhealthy lifestyle choices and genetics often play a large role. In Canada, heart disease is the second leading cause of death and a leading cause of hospitalization (Government of Canada, 2022). This statistic leads us to wonder and study whether a predictive model can determine the presence of heart disease in a patient. Therefore, based on a data set from 1988 consisting of 4 databases from, Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V, trends relating to heart disease will be used to predict the presence of the disease in individuals.

In reference to the maximum heart rate achieved, there is a higher mean value for individuals with a presence of heart disease.

    "In the end, we found the most significant predictors to be `age`, `thalach`, and `exang`, and the most optimal *k* value to be *k*=50. This resulting in the final models prediction accuracy to be approximately 75.5%. Since the final accuracy was pretty high , this classifier could be useful for predicting the presence of heart disease. With that in mind, it is important to remember that when put to use, the values for age, maximum heart rate achieved, and exercise induced angina may be less consistent with the values used to train and test this model. This may result to more frequent instances of missclassification, and a slightly different accuracy in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we were not expecting age to be as prominent of a factor as it was in making an accurate model. During the initial researching stage, we found that as age increases, the risk for heart disease also increases as, the heart and its connecting blood vessels are also aging (NIH, 2023). This however was not the trend we found when looking at the mean values for individuals who do have heart disease which, was a lower age compared to individuals without heart disease. This finding may lead to researchers looking into a younger age group when trying to find ways to identify risks for developing heart disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum heart rate achieved was also found to be a significant factor in detecting presence of heart disease. This brings to light a new how going over that heart rate can also increases risks of heart disease. As supported by Healthline, going over the maximum heart rate for an individuals age group can be dangerous for ones health (Healthline, 2023). This particular finding may highlight the importance of the maximum heart rate for individuals, and what a healthy and safe heart rate range is to reduce risks of developing heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise induced angina was not found in high instances in patients with heart disease. This was quite surprising but, made it an effective predictor variable as, it was very infrequently found  when an individual had heart disease. While this finding is unexpected, it highlights the significance of the risks of heart disease, even in the absence of some of the telltale signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the future, these findings may lead to different directions in research where the less expected predictors and parts of a health report can be used to determine risks of heart disease before a diagnosis is made. In turn, this may lead to questions of whether the current direction of research is the most effective, and if the stereotypical of a heart disease patient still holds true."
