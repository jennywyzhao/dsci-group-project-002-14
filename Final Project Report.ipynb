    "Heart disease is an umbrella term for a vast range of conditions that affect the heart. While there are many leading causes that can contribute to higher risks to heart disease, unhealthy lifestyle choices and genetics often play a large role. Based on a dataset from 1988 consisting of 4 databases, Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V, trends relating to heart disease will be used to predict the presence of it in individuals. Five attributes will be observed in order to successfully determine the presence of heart disease in a patient. Using the method of K-nearest neighbours classification, the question of \"Can heart disease in a patient be predicted prior to diagnoses using data on age, exercise induced angina, serum cholesterol levels and resting blood pressure?\"."
